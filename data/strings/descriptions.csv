gas_giant,CUSTOM,"Primarily composed of hydrogen and helium gases. The temperature and pressure at the core are extreme, but not enough to sustain the deuterium fusion that would turn the planet into a brown dwarf star.",,,,
ice_giant,CUSTOM,"A giant planet composed primarily of water, ammonia and methane. Within the depths, gravity generates enough pressure to form a core of metallic hydrogen.",,,,
lava,CUSTOM,"A geologically unstable planet without a permanently formed crust. Glowing fissures and active volcanoes litter the surface, the magma they spew forth combining to form flows that travel hundreds of kilometers across the charred surface.",,,,
frozen,CUSTOM,"Water or ammonia ice is the primary surface feature of this world. Below the surface, there may be a liquid ocean or a rocky crust.",,,,
barren,CUSTOM,Radiation from the nearby star ravages the surface of this world due to the lack of an atmospheric ozone layer. No significant geological activity. No indigenous life forms.,,,,
barren_deep_space,CUSTOM,A barren rock hurtling through space. No atmosphere and no significant geological activity.,,,,
toxic,CUSTOM,"Carbon and sulphur dioxide gases dominate the atmosphere of this world, making it toxic to all known life. In addition, the gases create a runaway greenhouse effect that increases surface temperature and atmospheric pressures to extremely high levels.",,,,
jungle,CUSTOM,"A lush and verdant biosphere sits on the surface of this water-rich world. Warm air and water currents permeate the planet's biosphere, leading to perfect conditions for flora and fauna at all latitudes.",,,,
terran,CUSTOM,"A geologically stable world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, a magnetic field and ample amounts of liquid water. The axis of rotation creates mild seasons. This type of planet is named for the reputed ancestral home of all human beings in the galaxy.",,,,
terran-eccentric,CUSTOM,A near-terran compatible ecosystem has taken tentative hold on this world despite highly abnormal planetary conditions. That this planet maintains a breathable atmosphere (or near enough) is a testament to the tenacity and adaptability of biological life.,,,,
desert,CUSTOM,"This planet is dry as bone and swirling with dust, stellar radiation mercilessly beats the surface. The life-sustaining water of this world has dissipated over the aeons due to a weak magnetic field.",,,,
desert1,CUSTOM,"This planet is dry as bone and swirling with dust, stellar radiation mercilessly beats the surface. The life-sustaining water of this world has dissipated over the aeons due to a weak magnetic field.",,,,
barren-desert,CUSTOM,"A deathly dry world, the surface exhibits the warm hue of oxidized iron compounds. A thin atmosphere prevails on worlds of this class, the predominant carbon dioxide stirred occasionally into planet-wide dust storms. Icecaps of atmospheric CO2 may form and sublime with the turn of the seasons.",,,,
arid,CUSTOM,"An inhospitable, dry world that has a much smaller percentage of water in its atmosphere than the terran standard. Nonetheless, an atmosphere and magnetic field protect the surface from stellar radiation permitting a small biosphere to slowly eke out an existence here.",,,,
tundra,CUSTOM,"A terran-extreme variant world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere maintained by a relatively subdued biosphere that exists largely within the oceans that undergo periodic thaw periods. The surface is very cold indeed, but it is human-viable if precautions are observed. Carbon dioxide may freeze out of the atmosphere at the poles during the local winter.",,,,
cryovolcanic,CUSTOM,"A frozen wasteland covered with volcanoes that erupt ammonia or more rarely, water instead of magma.",,,,
rocky_metallic,CUSTOM,"A rocky-metallic husk-world, its shattered landscape is a record of a violent history. Kilometers-deep chasms rive the surface and craters pit lava-fields beneath inert volcanoes that dwarf any of those on Old Earth. Planets like this are valued for mining operations. There is no significant ecology and only trace atmosphere.",,,,
rocky_unstable,CUSTOM,"An unstable world rocked by quakes and eruptions. Where the surface is not covered by seas of cooled lava, it is dominated by rough peaks and scattered supervolcanoes which eject toxic gases to form a tenuous and corrosive atmosphere. This is not a place welcoming to any kind of permanent settlement.",,,,
water,CUSTOM,A primitive atmosphere covers a world-ocean hundreds of kilometers deep. Its waters teem with primitive life and vast algae-analog mats can be seen by instruments from space. A core of water-ice over a rocky mantle is created by the terrific pressure of the sea.,,,,
rocky_ice,CUSTOM,"A frozen world of methane and ammonia, water-ice is like rock and may be found in mountainous outcroppings and boulders. A thin atmosphere of volatiles is formed on the starward side of the planet only to freeze again on the dark side. Most craters are filled in over time as this ""snow"" is deposited.",,,,

kaleidoscope_salty_arid,PLANET,"A dry planet marked by extensive salt flats and arid conditions. Its surface is layered with mineral deposits, and briny basins create unique, reflective landscapes under relentless sunlight.",,,,
kaleidoscope_rocky_arid,PLANET,"An arid rocky world with a rugged, barren terrain pockmarked by craters and wind-sculpted ridges. Sparse mineral veins tell tales of ancient geological forces at work.",,,,
kaleidoscope_barren_auric,PLANET,A lifeless sphere with a striking golden hue derived from abundant auric minerals. Its thin atmosphere and reflective surface produce an otherworldly shimmer beneath its star.,,,,
kaleidoscope_barren_cupric,PLANET,"This barren planet features rich, copper-toned surface formations. Oxidized minerals lend it a rusty appearance, while a feeble atmosphere provides scant protection from stellar radiation.",,,,
kaleidoscope_ferric_desert,PLANET,"Dominated by iron-rich soils, this vast desert exhibits a reddish, rusted landscape. Intense solar radiation and persistent dust storms sculpt a harsh yet mesmerizing environment.",,,,
kaleidoscope_false_sea_barren,PLANET,"A deceptive world that from afar appears to host vast, reflective seas; up close, however, it reveals itself as a barren expanse of mineral deposits, void of true liquid water.",,,,
kaleidoscope_methane_continental,PLANET,"An expansive continental planet where methane lakes and rivers define the landscape. Its cold, volatile atmosphere drives dynamic methane cycles that shape striking surface features.",,,,
kaleidoscope_rock_tundra,PLANET,"A rugged, frozen world where rocky outcroppings pierce a barren tundra. Subzero temperatures and hardy, sparse life forms characterize its harsh, wind-swept expanses.",,,,
kaleidoscope_basalt_desert,PLANET,"A desolate planet characterized by sprawling basaltic plainsâ€”the remnants of ancient volcanic activity. Dark, hardened surfaces are interspersed with crystalline formations carved by time.",,,,
kaleidoscope_salt_desert,PLANET,"A stark salt desert where evaporite minerals produce a blindingly white terrain. Extreme temperature swings and relentless evaporation create ever-changing, sculpted salt formations.",,,,
kaleidoscope_red_jungle,PLANET,"A vibrant jungle planet where deep red flora dominate the landscape. Rich, exotic biochemistry fuels an array of life forms adapted to thrive amid intense, crimson-hued vegetation.",,,,
kaleidoscope_liquid_metal,PLANET,"A planet defined by its flowing pools of molten metal. Extreme heat maintains these liquid surfaces, while electromagnetic interactions with metallic vapors create a dazzling, volatile spectacle.",,,,
kaleidoscope_archipelago,PLANET,"A waterworld dotted with scattered islands, remnants of ancient tectonic shifts. Vast, deep blue seas separate unique landmasses that harbor isolated and diverse ecosystems.",,,,
kaleidoscope_terran_boreal,PLANET,"A variant terran world characterized by expansive boreal forests and frigid climes. Its oxygen-rich atmosphere and abundant water support life, though prolonged winters enforce strict seasonal cycles.",,,,
kaleidoscope_fungal_eccentric,PLANET,"An eccentric planet where colossal fungal growth dominates the biosphere. Unusual chemical compositions and erratic weather patterns nurture bizarre, sprawling fungi in a truly alien ecosystem.",,,,
kaleidoscope_red_terran,PLANET,A terran-like planet with a distinctive red tint caused by iron-rich soils and a unique atmospheric blend. Its breathable air and stable geology offer familiar yet striking living conditions.,,,,
