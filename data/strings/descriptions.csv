kaleidoscope_salty_arid,PLANET,"A desiccated world where evaporated seas have left vast salt flats and crusted basins. Sparse life clings to the margins, feeding off mineral-rich brines while battered by the ever-present salt storms.",,,,
kaleidoscope_rocky_arid,PLANET,"A dry, stony world where exposed rock dominates the highlands, giving way to lowland basins that collect shallow pools of water. Sparse mineral deposits stain the surface, and erosion has carved deep channels through the rugged terrain. ",,,,
kaleidoscope_barren_auric,PLANET,A featureless expanse of pale stone streaked with metallic luster. Fine dust rich in gold compounds settles into cracks and depressions across the surface.,,,,
kaleidoscope_barren_cupric,PLANET,"A stark, airless world tinted green by copper oxides. Crags and plateaus rise from plains of weathered stone, their surfaces dulled by endless micrometeor impacts.",,,,
kaleidoscope_ferric_desert,PLANET,"A dry world of iron-rich sands and dark, oxidized stone. Broad plains of fine, rust-colored dust stretch between sharp ridges and isolated plateaus.",,,,
kaleidoscope_false_sea_barren,PLANET,"A deceptive world that from afar appears to host vast seas; up close, however, it reveals itself as a barren expanse of mineral deposits, void of true liquid water. Fine sediment gathers in soft layers, stirred only by passing currents of dust.",,,,
kaleidoscope_methane_continental,PLANET,"A cold world with scattered landmasses adrift in methane seas. Hydrocarbon rains feed sluggish rivers, carving black channels into the frostbitten plains.",,,,
kaleidoscope_rock_tundra,PLANET,"A frigid, rocky world where permafrost locks the highlands and shallow basins alike. Weak sunlight glints off scattered icefields, but life, where it exists, stays hidden beneath the stone.",,,,
kaleidoscope_basalt_desert,PLANET,"Endless fields of cooled basalt flow across the landscape of this world, hardened into rolling plains. Occasional fissures reveal the dark, glassy layers beneath.",,,,
kaleidoscope_salt_desert,PLANET,"Salt pans and brittle crusts dominate this dry planet, with jagged spires of mineral deposits standing sentinel over lifeless flats. Occasional quakes collapse entire regions into subsurface voids.",,,,
kaleidoscope_red_jungle,PLANET,"A dense, humid biosphere covers the surface, its foliage shaded in deep reds and purples. Photosynthetic processes here differ wildly from terran norms, though life thrives regardless.",,,,
kaleidoscope_liquid_metal,PLANET,"A planet-sized mass of nickel-iron alloy, the remnant core of a stripped giant. Surface activity is minimal, save for the slow migration of metal dunes under persistent micrometeorite impacts.",,,,
kaleidoscope_archipelago,PLANET,"Shallow seas cover much of the surface, broken by sprawling coral-like structures rising from the depths. Dense mineral accretions form tangled ridges and towers, sheltering intricate ecosystems within their hollows.",,,,
kaleidoscope_terran_boreal,PLANET,"A variant terran world characterized by expansive boreal forests and frigid climes. Its oxygen-rich atmosphere and abundant water support life, though prolonged winters enforce strict seasonal cycles.",,,,
kaleidoscope_fungal_eccentric,PLANET,"A marginally habitable world where massive fungal networks cover most landmasses. Strange atmospheric conditions encourage red-hued growths, pulsing dimly beneath heavy cloud cover.",,,,
kaleidoscope_red_terran,PLANET,An earthy world marked by iron-rich soil and hardy vegetation in muted reds and browns. Rolling plains and shallow basins spread between clustered woodlands.,,,,
kaleidoscope_gem_tundra,PLANET,"A frostbound world where veins of crystalline minerals thread through frozen soil and exposed bedrock. Ice-coated gemstones protrude from the permafrost, dulled by time yet still catching the light in muted glimmers. The land is quiet, shaped by slow glaciation and the occasional distant crack of shifting ice.",,,,
kaleidoscope_pangean_water,PLANET,"A world-ocean uninterrupted by continents, save for a single, massive landmass. Rugged coastlines give way to highlands, with deep channels carved by constant rain.",,,,
kaleidoscope_fungal,PLANET,"Thick fungal forests cover this damp, temperate world. Spores drift constantly in the air, and most native life has adapted to symbiosis - or competition - with the dominant mycelial networks.",,,,
kaleidoscope_brine,PLANET,"A dry world of shallow, salty seas and arid plains. Mineral-rich flats stretch between low ridges, with briny lakes forming in depressions. Occasional storms leave behind brief pools of hypersaline liquid before the heat dries them away.",,,,
kaleidoscope_barren_smooth,PLANET,"A barren world with an unusually smooth, reflective surface. Metallic deposits and glass-like plains catch the light, creating a dull sheen across the landscape. Few features break the monotony, save for the occasional fissure or impact scar.",,,,
kaleidoscope_barren_sulphuric,PLANET,"A lifeless world coated in sulfur deposits and weathered by acidic trace elements. The surface is marked by yellow-stained plains, corroded ridges, and the faint remnants of past volcanic activity. Thin wisps of sulfuric haze linger in the lowlands.",,,,
kaleidoscope_arid_sea,PLANET,"A world of shallow seas and arid expanses. Brackish waters recede into salt-crusted shorelines, while rocky plateaus and dry basins dominate the interior. Occasional storms stir the dust, but little moisture lingers beyond the coasts.",,,,
kaleidoscope_cracked_barren,PLANET,"A desolate world of fractured stone and deep fissures. The surface is split by ancient tectonic stresses, leaving behind a landscape of jagged ridges and dust-filled chasms. Sparse mineral deposits catch the light, but little else breaks the monotony of its worn terrain.",,,,
